                <h2>Sonnet 40: Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all</h2>
                <h4>BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</h4>
                <p>Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all:</p>
                <p>What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?</p>
                <p>No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call—</p>
                <p>All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.</p>
                <p>Then if for my love thou my love receivest,</p>
                <p>I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;</p>
                <p> But yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest</p>
                <p> By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.</p>
                <p> I do forgive thy robb’ry, gentle thief,</p>
                <p> Although thou steal thee all my poverty;</p>
                <p> And yet love knows it is a greater grief</p>
                <p> To bear love’s wrong than hate’s known injury.</p>
                <p> Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,</p>
                <p> Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.</p>

                <hr>
                <h2>A Glimpse</h2>
                <h4>BY WALT WHITMAN</h4>
                <p>A glimpse through an interstice caught,</p>
                <p> Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room around the stove late of a winter night, and I unremark’d seated in a corner,</p>
                <p> Of a youth who loves me and whom I love, silently approaching and seating himself near, that he may hold me by the hand,</p>
                <p> A long while amid the noises of coming and going, of drinking and oath and smutty jest,</p>
                <p> There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little, perhaps not a word.</p>

                <hr>
                <h2>[love is more thicker than forget] </h2>
                <h4>BY E. E. CUMMINGS</h4>
                <p>love is more thicker than forget</p>
                <p> more thinner than recall</p>
                <p> more seldom than a wave is wet</p>
                <p> more frequent than to fail</p>

                <p> it is most mad and moonly</p>
                <p> and less it shall unbe</p>
                <p> than all the sea which only</p>
                <p> is deeper than the sea</p>

                <p> love is less always than to win</p>
                <p> less never than alive</p>
                <p> less bigger than the least begin</p>
                <p> less littler than forgive</p>

                <p> it is most sane and sunly</p>
                <p> and more it cannot die</p>
                <p> than all the sky which only</p>
                <p> is higher than the sky</p>

                <h2>Sonnet: I Thank You</h2>
                <h4>BY HENRY TIMROD</h4>
                <p>I thank you, kind and best beloved friend,</p>
                <p> With the same thanks one murmurs to a sister,</p>
                <p> When, for some gentle favor, he hath kissed her,</p>
                <p> Less for the gifts than for the love you send,</p>
                <p> Less for the flowers, than what the flowers convey;</p>
                <p> If I, indeed, divine their meaning truly,</p>
                <p> And not unto myself ascribe, unduly,</p>
                <p> Things which you neither meant nor wished to say,</p>
                <p> Oh! tell me, is the hope then all misplaced?</p>
                <p> And am I flattered by my own affection?</p>
                <p> But in your beauteous gift, methought I traced</p>
                <p> Something above a short-lived predilection,</p>
                <p> And which, for that I know no dearer name,</p>
                <p> I designate as love, without love’s flame.</p>

                <h2>Sonnet 65: Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea</h2>
                <h4>BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</h4>
                <p>Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea</p>
                <p> But sad mortality o’er-sways their power,</p>
                <p> How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,</p>
                <p> Whose action is no stronger than a flower?</p>
                <p> O, how shall summer’s honey breath hold out</p>
                <p> Against the wrackful siege of batt’ring days,</p>
                <p> When rocks impregnable are not so stout,</p>
                <p> Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?</p>
                <p> O fearful meditation! where, alack,</p>
                <p> Shall time’s best jewel from time’s chest lie hid?</p>
                <p> Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?</p>
                <p> Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?</p>
                <p> O, none, unless this miracle have might,</p>
                <p> That in black ink my love may still shine bright.</p>

                <h2>Love and Friendship</h2>
                <h4>BY EMILY BRONTË</h4>
                <p>Love is like the wild rose-briar,</p>
                <p> Friendship like the holly-tree—</p>
                <p> The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms</p>
                <p> But which will bloom most constantly?</p>
                <p> The wild rose-briar is sweet in spring</p>
                <p> Its summer blossoms scent the air;</p>
                <p> Yet wait till winter comes again</p>
                <p> And who will call the wild-briar fair?</p>
                <p> Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now</p>
                <p>And deck thee with the holly’s sheen,</p>
                <p>That when December blights thy brow</p>
                <p>He still may leave thy garland green.</p>
                <br>
