                <h3>A MI SEBONGIE</h3>
                <br>
                <p>My young heart was only so playful back then. When I saw you smile, I felt something cause I never learned any of this. What I thought only happened in movies or TV shows, something like that is happening to me too. On one fine day, you magically appeared in my life. You took my heart and attracted my eyes. Ever since you came, my life has been so beautiful. Things may seem repetitive, but when I’m with you, they turn special. When people say they cried a lot because of you, I didn’t understand before but now I do. Each moment with you my joy grows, just by looking at you, I smile without even knowing. As each day pass by, my feelings for you just grows even deeper. Ever since the first day I met you until now, in my heart it's only you. My heart won’t change, it won’t ever change, even if you erase me.</p>

                <h3>PARA MIS AMIGOS</h3>
                <br>
                <p> We were so young, those days were so pretty, deep in our memories. Each memory of ours together, I haven’t forgotten any of them. You even liked my clumsy moments, but I wonder if I even deserve that love. I long for the days when we were so honest. Sometimes it hurt, sometimes it was embarrassing, which is why I’m so grateful for the times we lived with no boundaries. We could share everything and we had the same dream. When my love was gone, you were there, you told me I can find love again after I learn to let go. You just listened to me for a long time even if I cried without any words. I didn't realize these feelings which is thankful and sorry until now. These typical words I’m only saying them now, but I hope these words will reach you. Thank you, thank you that’s all I can say. Even all the waiting, the longing and all of our memories, thank you. To this beautiful feeling.I can smile because we’re together, I can cry because it’s you. So what can’t I do? Even though everything has changed and time went away, you are still with me. Don’t say it’s the end because I’ll stay by your side forever. Whatever happens, whenever, wherever, just like always, we’ll be together.</p>
                <br>


                <hr>
                <h3>A MIS PADRES</h3>
                <br>
                <p> There are not enough words to describe how I feel. I know I don't show how grateful I am enough, but I really am. You always waited for me at that spot. You embraced me with your arms, I'm so thankful for you. I won’t ever forget, I will make you happy, I will make you proud. When I can’t find a place to stand, when I am lost inside a storm, you unchangingly gave me love and courage. Thank you, I’m sorry, I love you.</p>
